Weather JSON Storage

This repository is designed to store JSON data retrieved from a weather API. The JSON file is updated regularly and served publicly via GitHub Pages to facilitate easy access to up-to-date weather data.

Overview

The data.json file in this repository contains weather data fetched from a specific weather API. This repository uses automated scripts to update this file periodically, ensuring the data remains current.

Usage

The JSON data stored here can be accessed publicly via the following URL:

https://{your-github-username}.github.io/weather-json-storage/data.json

This URL serves the data.json file as a static webpage, which can be used by developers, researchers, or anyone interested in using live weather data for their projects.

Automated Updates

Updates to the JSON file are managed through automated scripts running on the Scriptable app on iOS. These scripts fetch the latest weather data from the API and update the data.json file in this repository.
